Hello and welcome to my GitHub.

This folder will contain common exercises from a Data Stuctures and Algorithm course.

Some exercises will contain multiple solutions, with notes on how each solution works. All extra solutions are commented out so that the tests can run successfully. Feel free to test out all of the solutions provided for each problem.

All of my tests are ran using jest watch on the test files provided, or node-inspect, but can also be ran in any JS playground.
