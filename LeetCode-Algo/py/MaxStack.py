# A regular stack already supports the first 3 operations, so we focus on the last two.

# For peekMax, we remember the largest value we've seen on the side. For example if we add [2, 1, 5, 3, 9], we'll remember [2, 2, 5, 5, 9]. This works seamlessly with pop operations, and also it's easy to compute: it's just the maximum of the element we are adding and the previous maximum.

# For popMax, we know what the current maximum (peekMax) is. We can pop until we find that maximum, then push the popped elements back on the stack.

# Our implementation in Python will showcase extending the list class.

# Time Complexity: O(N) for popMax
